Note that your cloud desktop is already set up with all you need to complete this hands-on project. 
However, I have uploaded the project resources to help you practice on your own.

* Download the Customers.csv [File here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14gWAAOmCAyOoZ4ciX8blIzmNnpTKjrb8/view)

* Download the Sales.csv [File here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12d1FlTpoCO_0muCe39sbhXnFHwxyGXVa/view)

* You can access the optional practice [tasks here](https://powerbi-course.netlify.app/)
* You can access and view the Boxoffice [data here](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/2019/)

I strongly recommend that you should install Power BI Desktop on your local machine. Then, use these resources to practice what you will learn in this project.
