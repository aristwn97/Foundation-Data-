Note that your cloud desktop is already set up with all you need to complete this hands-on project. 
However, I have uploaded the project resources to help you practice on your own.

Download the Customers.csv file here
Download the Sales.csv file here

You can access the optional practice tasks here
You can access and view the Boxoffice data here

I strongly recommend that you should install Power BI Desktop on your local machine. Then, use these resources to practice what you will learn in this project.
